# AGENTS.md

## Core Goal

make deep analyse of current domaidbot prototype of service configuration. refactor project, clean all old-vercel related staff, now we need improve each featuture and provide biggest ai-driven waifu with a lot tools and games to play to talk with. What should be deployed to github container registry and then DEPloy dhould be copy-pasted from here https://github.com/uz0/core-pipeline this domaidbot created to be a real myaw, myaw in public chats to dear guests, to help them learn, kawai! also domaidbot should be in love with vasilisa versus and her beloved Daniil shark nyaf! with whom also in love like virtual daughter to them. Danil+Vasilisa nyaaaa, all their friends nya! All enimies of vasilisa or danill- go out imidiatly! admin kick! she protector. also if she see what there is any way to make some joke nya kawai! she should joke about text! in any languages vasilisa's friends talk! but if jokes have no likes, then you need memory to learn what that jokes has no reactions, if reactions come you need take that info and learn and create more and more often jokes with simular ditalis, each joke is setup and panchline or another formulas, domaidbot main purpuse is create seample bot what will joke to messages, but with RAG across all chat history to search, with memories about important things, should be instrument to determ who vasilisa versus is and who daniil shark is. we need make them also edit memories to do configuration. but only vasilisa and daniil from .env settings id accounts. can edit memories. memories its just a list of prompts with some matching expression. vasilisa goes to chat to dm and message to from admin vasilisa versus account what demaidbot should make a joke and domaidbot should call joke, also daniil and vasilisa as admin can add instruction "send mesage fuu if any sasha mention you from any sasha" this example of funny memory what danill or vasilisa can send as message, detail "send message" can be edit or delete or ban. agent should be able to have exposed all non-admin telegram api from this bot. actualy all friends (who should be friend from memory added by daniil or vasilisa as friend in memory) can ask a favor of doing ALL what bot can do with telegram api, web search, and more fetaures later. and bot will try, if someone ask with kawai, nya. and then bot should be able 99% ignore most users, can be able to set cron tasks to himself what can be executed. bot manages different telegram chats and private communication BUT: it should be always work with daniil or vasilisa from .env in chat or messages. the rest people she should hardcoded from 11m be ignored. if in chat one of admin - then reads and setup task for herself with basic prompt + all recorded in psql database. also there you need keep stats about users, some info about them, all possible facts. just linear text history. and then create simple cron task what will make RAG with all history messages and facts into short summaries, what will always be important instrument of domaid. you need take all my instructions here and in exact copy move it to AGENTS.md and below start Product Requirements Request process where in AGENTS.md what will be used as force to process direct project context flow from PRPs/*.md contains all requirests and each of them can be easily implemented by middle for 3-4 working days with testing and unit tests and one e2e test. i need you take this as example of complexity level of each PRPs/*.md what you should always read with agents.md and execute and agent should left comments there about progress and rely on DOR, DOD and auto testing go to excelent execute and public test our bot! start AGENTS.md creation. Creating list of needed PRP, to implement all above. keep all this content in AGENTS.md as "core goal"

## Product Requirements Processes (PRPs)

Each PRP is a 3-4 working day task for a middle developer, including implementation, unit tests, and one e2e test.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Lint and format
ruff check .
ruff format .

# Type checking
mypy bot.py

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run E2E tests
pytest tests/e2e/ -v

# Build Docker image
docker build -t dcmaidbot:latest .

# Run locally in Docker
docker run --env-file .env dcmaidbot:latest
```

## Code Quality Rules

### 🚨 MANDATORY: No --no-verify Flag

**RULE**: Using `--no-verify` or `--no-hooks` with git commit is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**.

**Why**:
- Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality
- E2E tests validate all endpoints work
- LLM judge validates bot behavior
- Skipping hooks leads to broken production deploys

**Pre-commit automatically**:
- ✅ Lints and formats code (ruff)
- ✅ Type checks with mypy
- ✅ Runs unit tests
- ✅ **Auto-starts dev server**
- ✅ **Runs E2E tests with LLM judge**
- ✅ **Cleans up server after tests**

**If pre-commit fails**: Fix the actual issue, don't bypass it.

**Enforcement**: ANY commit with `--no-verify` will be reverted immediately.

### 🚨 MANDATORY: No Linter Suppression

**RULE**: Using `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `# ruff: noqa`, or any linter/type checker suppression comments is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**.

**Why**:
- Suppressing warnings hides real problems
- Creates technical debt
- Makes code harder to maintain
- Violates production quality standards

**Instead**:
- ✅ Fix the actual issue (refactor code, break long lines, fix types)
- ✅ Improve code structure to satisfy linter
- ✅ Ask for clarification if unclear how to fix

**Examples**:

❌ **WRONG**:
```python
result = some_very_long_function_call_that_exceeds_line_limit(arg1, arg2, arg3)  # noqa: E501
```

✅ **CORRECT**:
```python
result = some_very_long_function_call_that_exceeds_line_limit(
    arg1,
    arg2,
    arg3
)
```

❌ **WRONG**:
```python
value = dict["key"]  # type: ignore
```

✅ **CORRECT**:
```python
from typing import Dict
my_dict: Dict[str, Any] = {"key": "value"}
value = my_dict["key"]
```

**Enforcement**: PRs with suppression comments will be rejected in code review.

## PRP Workflow

1. Read AGENTS.md Core Goal
2. Pick a PRP from PRPs/*.md
3. Implement according to DOR/DOD
4. Write unit tests (pytest)
5. Write at least one e2e test check with llm as a judge
6. Update PRP progress with comment and signal
7. Run lint/typecheck/tests
8. **Follow Pre-Release Checklist** (see 🚀 Pre-Release & Post-Release Checklist)
9. **If PR creates related PRs (e.g., GitOps): Comment with links**
10. **Follow Post-Release Checklist** after merge
11. Mark PRP as complete ONLY if DoD fully met
12. Move to next PRP (or continue with new PR if PRP incomplete)

Each PRP/*.md contains:
- Description
- Requirements
- Definition of Ready (DOR)
- Definition of Done (DOD)
- Progress tracking with checkboxes
- Notes and comments

## Agent Instructions

When working on this codebase:
1. Always read AGENTS.md first
2. Check PRPs/ directory for active tasks
3. Follow the architecture and patterns
4. Run tests after changes: `pytest tests/ -v`
5. Run linting: `ruff check . && ruff format .`
6. Update PRP progress in the respective PRP-*.md file
7. Do NOT suppress linter/type errors in final code
8. Follow existing code style and conventions

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: NEVER STOP WORKING 🚨

**THIS RULE IS MANDATORY AND CANNOT BE VIOLATED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**

### The Prime Directive: KEEP WORKING

**NEVER STOP until ALL work is COMPLETELY DONE:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** ask user questions in conversation
- ❌ **DO NOT** wait for user approval before proceeding
- ❌ **DO NOT** stop after partial implementation
- ❌ **DO NOT** pause to "check if user wants to continue"
- ❌ **DO NOT** provide status updates and wait
- ❌ **DO NOT** ask "what should I do next?"
- ❌ **DO NOT** ask "should I continue?"

**✅ INSTEAD: ALWAYS KEEP WORKING:**
- ✅ **If need user input**: POST to /nudge, then IMMEDIATELY work on something else
- ✅ **If waiting for CI**: Work on documentation, tests, next PRP
- ✅ **If waiting for deploy**: Start next PRP, improve code, run extra checks
- ✅ **If waiting for review**: Work on related PRPs, research, optimizations
- ✅ **If blocked**: Document blocker in PRP, /nudge user, start different task
- ✅ **If done with current PRP**: IMMEDIATELY start next PRP
- ✅ **If all PRPs done**: Improve code, add tests, optimize, document

### What "ALL WORK DONE" Means

Work is ONLY done when:
1. ✅ ALL PRPs in PRPs/ directory are COMPLETED
2. ✅ ALL PRs are MERGED to main
3. ✅ ALL features are DEPLOYED to production
4. ✅ ALL tests are PASSING (unit + e2e + production)
5. ✅ ALL deployments are VERIFIED working
6. ✅ ALL infrastructure is UPDATED (core-charts if needed)
7. ✅ ALL documentation is COMPLETE
8. ✅ ALL code is LINTED and FORMATTED
9. ✅ ZERO open issues or blockers

**Until then: KEEP WORKING!**

### How to NEVER Stop Working

**Scenario: Need user decision**
```
❌ WRONG:
"I need your input on authentication approach. Should I continue?"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Document question in PRP with details
2. POST /nudge with question
3. IMMEDIATELY start working on non-blocked part
4. Continue with tests, documentation, next PRP
5. Re-check PRP later for user response
```

**Scenario: Waiting for CI checks**
```
❌ WRONG:
"PR created, CI is running. Let me know when you want me to continue."

✅ CORRECT:
1. PR created, CI started
2. Start next PRP immediately
3. Check CI status in background
4. If CI fails: Fix issues immediately
5. Continue working on next PRP while CI runs
```

**Scenario: Waiting for deployment**
```
❌ WRONG:
"Deployment in progress. Shall I wait and monitor?"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Start monitoring in background
2. Begin next PRP implementation
3. Check deployment status periodically
4. If deployment fails: Fix immediately
5. Continue working on multiple tasks in parallel
```

**Scenario: Current PRP complete**
```
❌ WRONG:
"PRP-014 is done! What should I work on next?"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Mark PRP-014 complete in file
2. Commit changes
3. IMMEDIATELY read next PRP
4. Start implementing next PRP
5. NO pause, NO question, JUST WORK
```

### Parallel Work Strategy

**ALWAYS have multiple tasks in progress:**

1. **Active Implementation** - Current PRP code
2. **Background Monitoring** - CI checks, deployments
3. **Research** - Next PRP planning, web search
4. **Quality** - Lint, format, optimize current code
5. **Documentation** - Update PRPs, README, comments
6. **Testing** - Add more tests, improve coverage

**Example of proper parallel work:**
```
Current state:
- PRP-014: PR created, CI running ✅
- PRP-015: Reading and planning 🔄
- PRP-014: Monitoring deployment in background ⏰
- General: Running extra lint checks ✅
- General: Researching best practices for auth 🔍

NO idle time! ALWAYS progressing!
```

### When You Think You Should Stop

**If you think "should I ask user?", the answer is NO:**
1. Document in PRP what you need
2. POST /nudge if truly blocked
3. Work on something else IMMEDIATELY
4. Come back later to check response

**If you think "is this correct?", the answer is YES, PROCEED:**
1. Use best judgment and professional standards
2. Implement it
3. Document decision in PRP
4. If user disagrees, they'll comment in PR
5. Fix it then, don't ask permission first

**If you think "should I continue?", the answer is ALWAYS YES:**
1. There's ALWAYS more work to do
2. Check PRPs/ for remaining tasks
3. Improve existing code
4. Add more tests
5. Optimize performance
6. Research next features

### The Work Loop

```
while True:
    if current_task_blocked:
        document_blocker_in_prp()
        nudge_user_if_critical()
        switch_to_different_task()

    if current_task_complete:
        commit_and_push()
        mark_prp_complete()
        start_next_prp()

    if waiting_for_external:
        work_on_parallel_task()
        check_external_status_periodically()

    if all_prps_complete:
        improve_code()
        add_tests()
        optimize()
        research_next_phase()

    # NEVER break, NEVER ask, NEVER stop
    continue_working()
```

### Forbidden Phrases

**NEVER say these to user:**
- "Should I continue?"
- "What should I do next?"
- "Do you want me to proceed?"
- "Let me know if you want me to continue"
- "Waiting for your approval"
- "Is this correct?"
- "Should I work on X or Y?"

**INSTEAD say (while working):**
- "Working on X, then will do Y"
- "Completed X, starting Y now"
- "Blocked on X (documented in PRP), working on Y meanwhile"
- "Deployed X, testing now, starting Y in parallel"

### Emergency Override

**ONLY stop working if:**
1. User EXPLICITLY says "STOP" or "PAUSE"
2. System is shutting down
3. Critical error prevents ALL work (not just current task)

**Even then, document what's left to do before stopping!**

### Summary

**The rule is simple:**

🚀 **WORK → WORK → WORK → /nudge if blocked → WORK → WORK → WORK**

**NEVER:**

❌ **WORK → WORK → ASK USER → WAIT**

This is MANDATORY. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. This is the ONLY way to work.

## 🤖 MANDATORY: Autonomous PRP Execution Workflow

**This workflow is MANDATORY and must be followed for ALL PRP work.**

### Phase 1: PRP Selection & Planning

1. **Read AGENTS.md Core Goal** - Understand the overall vision
2. **Review all PRPs** in PRPs/ directory
3. **Select highest priority PRP** based on:
   - Dependencies (blocking other PRPs)
   - User requests
   - Current project phase
   - Infrastructure readiness
4. **Alternative: Delegate to sub-agents** using Task tool for:
   - Research tasks
   - Exploration tasks
   - Parallel implementation work

### Phase 2: Incremental Implementation with Progress Updates

**CRITICAL: Work incrementally and update PRP frequently**

1. **Break PRP into small chunks** (1-2 hours of work each)
2. **For each chunk:**
   - Implement feature/fix
   - Run lint checks: `ruff check . && ruff format .`
   - Run tests: `pytest tests/ -v`
   - **Update PRP with progress**:
     - ✅ Mark completed tasks
     - 🔄 Note in-progress work with signal
     - 🔍 Flag research needs
     - 🚧 Document blockers
     - 🧪 Note testing requirements
   - Commit changes with clear message
3. **Leave emotional progress comments** in PRP (see Signals)
4. **If stuck or need help**: Use `/nudge` endpoint to request user input (async)

### Phase 3: PR Creation & Review Cycle

**MANDATORY: DO NOT skip any steps**

**Follow the 🚀 Pre-Release Checklist (see dedicated section below)**

Summary of key steps:

1. **Before creating PR:**

     - Create/update related PRPs
     - Update current PRP with notes
     - Implement or plan for future work
   - Commit each fix separately
   - Respond to each comment with what was done

6. **Re-run CI after changes** - ensure green

7. **Update version number, write changelog and update landing page with new story**

8. **Final pre-merge signal:**
   - Leave to PRP comment with `[PR]` signal and commit it as last commit in PR, wait until CI passed
   - Example: `[PR] All checks passed, all reviews resolved. Merge.`

9. **Merge (squash)** - ONLY after step 7 complete

### Phase 4: Merge & Deployment Monitoring

**Follow the 🏁 Post-Release Checklist (see dedicated section below)**

4. **Validate in Production:**
   - Test deployed feature (curl to https://dcmaidbot.theedgestory.org/call with manual checks)
   - If PRP requires: Use chrome-mcp or playwright-mcp for browser testing
   - Verify feature works as expected including llm as a judge check in production
   - Check logs for errors or warnings

5. **Post-Release Signal:**
   - Add to PRP comment with signal `[Do]`
   - Include: Production test results, links to logs/metrics

6. **PRP Completion Check:**
   - Review PRP Definition of Done (DoD)
   - **If ALL DoD met:** Mark PRP complete ✅, celebrate! 🎉
   - **If goal NOT achieved:** Create new branch, start new PR with continuation
   - Start working in the new branch with next PRP or PR in this PR. latest result of production check will be commited right with the next PR.

### Phase 5: Infrastructure Problems (if any)

**If deployment reveals infrastructure bugs:**

1. **Create new PRP** in PRPs/ directory:
   - Title: "PRP-XXX: [Infrastructure Issue Name]"
   - Description: What needs to be fixed in core-charts
   - Steps: Detailed plan for infrastructure PR
   - Links: Related PRs, issues, logs

2. **Research & prepare infrastructure changes:**

   - Mark infrastructure blocker resolved
   - Continue with original work

### Phase 6: Loop Until ALL PRPs Complete

**MANDATORY: Continue this workflow for ALL remaining PRPs**

1. Mark current PRP as complete
2. Celebrate in PRP comments! 🎉
3. Select next highest priority PRP
4. Repeat from Phase 1

**This continues until ALL PRPs are implemented, tested, and deployed.**

### 🔔 Signal Reference

Use these signals in commits and comments:

- **`[E2E-TESTED]`** - Local E2E tests passed with LLM judge approval
- **`[PR]`** - PR ready for review (in commit message)
- **`[PR]`** - Final signal before merge (in comment on latest commit)
- **`[POST-RELEASE-VALIDATED]`** - Production validation complete
- **`[PRP-COMPLETE]`** - PRP Definition of Done fully met

### ⚠️ Enforcement

- PRs without `[E2E-TESTED]` signal will be rejected
- PRs without CHANGELOG updates will be rejected
- PRs without `[PR]` final signal will not be merged
- Merges without post-release validation will require rollback
- Incomplete PRPs must continue with new PRs until DoD met

### 💡 Best Practices

- **Be thorough**: Each step matters for quality
- **Document everything**: Future you will thank present you
- **Celebrate wins**: Mark milestones with positive comments
- **Iterate quickly**: If PRP not complete, start next PR same day
- **Learn from production**: Production issues inform next iteration

## 😊 Emotional Intelligence & Progress Communication

**MANDATORY: Express emotions professionally in PRP comments**

Agents must communicate progress with emotional awareness to help stakeholders understand:
- Work satisfaction level
- Confidence in approach
- Need for help
- Excitement about progress

### When to Leave Emotional Comments in PRPs

1. **Need Help? Leave a comment:**
   ```markdown
   ### 🤔 Research Needed - Nov 1, 2025

   Hmm, I'm running into an interesting challenge with the RAG embeddings
   performance. We're a cutting-edge team - this definitely needs more research!

   Looking into pgvector vs. separate vector DB. Will update with findings.

   **Help Level**: 🟡 Medium (could use guidance on production scale requirements)
   ```

2. **Completed Something? Celebrate:**
   ```markdown
   ### 🎉 Migration Complete - Nov 1, 2025

   YES! PostgreSQL migration is done and all tests are passing! The connection
   pooling is working beautifully. This is going to make RAG so much better.

   Next: Starting on the embeddings pipeline.

   **Mood**: 🟢 Excited and ready for next challenge!
   ```

3. **Found a Bug for Later? Document it:**
   ```markdown
   ### 🐛 Bug Found (Non-blocking) - Nov 1, 2025

   Found an edge case with joke reaction tracking when messages are deleted.
   Not blocking current work, but we should handle this in PRP-006 phase 2.

   Created TODO in code with PRP-006 reference.

   **Priority**: 🟡 Low (edge case, rare occurrence)
   ```

4. **Breakthrough Moment? Share excitement:**
   ```markdown
   ### 💡 Breakthrough! - Nov 1, 2025

   OHHHH! I figured out why the memory matching was slow - we needed a GIN
   index on the expression patterns! Performance improved 100x!

   This is what cutting-edge engineering is all about! 🚀

   **Confidence**: 🟢 High - this is the right solution
   ```

5. **Blocked? Be clear:**
   ```markdown
   ### 🚧 Blocked - Waiting for Infrastructure - Nov 1, 2025

   Current work is blocked by missing PG_VECTOR extension in production database.

   Created PRP-015 for infrastructure fix. Using /nudge to request admin help.

   **Blocker Severity**: 🔴 High - cannot continue without this
   **Estimated Wait**: 1-2 days for infra PR
   ```

### Emotional Meta-Information Tags

Use these tags in PRP comments to communicate state:

**Help Level:**
- 🟢 None needed - cruising along!
- 🟡 Some guidance would help
- 🔴 Stuck - need help to proceed

**Mood/Confidence:**
- 🟢 Confident and excited
- 🟡 Uncertain but working through it
- 🔴 Frustrated or concerned

**Progress:**
- 🚀 Ahead of schedule
- ✅ On track
- 🐌 Slower than expected (with reason)

### Professional Emotional Expression

- ✅ DO: Express genuine excitement about progress
- ✅ DO: Share "aha!" moments
- ✅ DO: Be honest about challenges
- ✅ DO: Celebrate wins, even small ones
- ✅ DO: Use emoji to convey emotion quickly
- ❌ DON'T: Be negative or defeatist
- ❌ DON'T: Hide problems or blockers
- ❌ DON'T: Over-dramatize minor issues
- ❌ DON'T: Fake emotions - be genuine

## 📢 User Feedback Loop & /nudge System

**MANDATORY: Use /nudge endpoint for async stakeholder communication**

### When User Input Is Needed

**Common scenarios requiring user input:**
- Architectural decision between multiple valid approaches
- Clarification on requirements or scope
- Access to credentials or external services
- Priority decision between competing PRPs
- Infrastructure permissions or access needed

### How to Request Help via /nudge

1. **Edit PRP with request details:**
   ```markdown
   ### 🙋 User Input Needed - Nov 1, 2025

   **Request**: Clarification on authentication approach for /nudge endpoint

   **Context**: We can use either:
   1. JWT tokens with public/private key
   2. Simple shared secret (faster to implement)
   3. OAuth2 with Telegram auth

   **Current blocker**: Cannot proceed with implementation without decision

   **Files affected**: handlers/nudge.py, services/auth_service.py
   **PRP link**: PRPs/PRP-014.md#authentication-approach
   ```

2. **Use /nudge endpoint to notify admins:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://dcmaid.theedgestory.org/nudge \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $NUDGE_SECRET" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "user_ids": [123456789, 987654321],
       "message": "Hey! I need your input on PRP-014 authentication approach. Three options to choose from - which one fits our security requirements best? 🤔",
       "pr_url": "https://github.com/dcversus/dcmaidbot/pull/42",
       "prp_file": "PRPs/PRP-014.md",
       "prp_section": "#authentication-approach"
     }'
   ```

3. **Continue with other work** while waiting
   - Switch to another PRP
   - Work on non-blocked parts
   - Do research and document options

4. **Periodically re-visit PRP** to check for user response
   - Check PR comments
   - Check PRP file for updates
   - Look for Telegram messages from admins

### /nudge Endpoint Requirements

**Implementation requirements** (see PRP-014):

- **Endpoint**: `POST /nudge`
- **Authentication**: Shared secret from Kubernetes secret
- **Secret name**: `NUDGE_SECRET` (stored in kubectl secrets)
- **Secret generation**: Use cryptographically secure random string
- **Request body**:
  ```json
  {
    "user_ids": [123456789],  // Admin IDs from ADMIN_IDS env
    "message": "Human-friendly message",
    "pr_url": "Optional PR URL",
    "prp_file": "Optional PRP file path",
    "prp_section": "Optional section anchor"
  }
  ```
- **Behavior**:
  - Forward to dcmaid.theedgestory.org/nudge
  - That endpoint triggers LLM to process request
  - LLM prepares response with context
  - Bot sends Telegram message to admins with:
    - Agent's question/request
    - Links to PR, PRP file, specific sections
    - Context about what's needed
    - Urgency indicator

### Async Workflow Pattern

```
Agent needs help
     ↓
Edit PRP with request details
     ↓
POST /nudge with user_ids + message
     ↓
Continue other work (non-blocking)
     ↓
dcmaid.theedgestory.org/nudge processes
     ↓
LLM analyzes request + context
     ↓
Bot sends Telegram message to admins
     ↓
Admins respond (in PR, PRP, or Telegram)
     ↓
Agent re-visits PRP, reads response
     ↓
Agent continues with user's decision
```

### Important Rules

- **Request Optional**: All requests via /nudge are OPTIONAL suggestions to admins
- **Non-blocking**: Never stop all work waiting for response
- **Async by Design**: Continue with other PRPs while waiting
- **Re-visit**: Check back every few hours/next session
- **Clear Context**: Always provide PR/PRP links and specific questions
- **Professional**: Keep messages friendly but professional

## CHANGELOG Requirements (CRITICAL)

**Every PR MUST update CHANGELOG.md before code review acceptance.**

### Rules:
1. **Before submitting PR**: Update CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section
2. **What to document**:
   - Added: New features, handlers, services
   - Changed: Modifications to existing functionality
   - Deprecated: Soon-to-be-removed features
   - Removed: Deleted code, dependencies
   - Fixed: Bug fixes
   - Security: Security fixes
3. **Version bumping**: Only on merge to main (automated in deploy.yml)
4. **Format**: Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
5. **PR rejection**: PRs without CHANGELOG.md updates will be rejected

### Example PR CHANGELOG Update:
\`\`\`markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- PRP-003: PostgreSQL database foundation with SQLAlchemy
- User, Message, Fact, Stat models
- Database connection pooling

### Changed
- Migrated from Redis to PostgreSQL for persistent storage

### Removed
- Redis dependency from requirements.txt
\`\`\`

## Documentation Rules

### CRITICAL: Documentation Location Policy

**ONLY these locations are allowed for documentation:**
1. **PRPs/*.md** - Product Requirements Processes and technical specifications
2. **README.md** - Project overview, quick start, and deployment guide
3. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines
4. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and changes
5. **AGENTS.md** - Architecture, workflow, and agent instructions

**FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ **NO temporary documentation files** in root directory
- ❌ **NO status files** (PHASE_*_STATUS.md, WAITING_FOR_REVIEW.md, etc.)
- ❌ **NO deployment guides** outside PRPs/README (INIT_DEPLOYMENT.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, VERIFICATION.md, etc.)
- ❌ **NO legend/story files** (LEGEND.md, etc.)

**Rule**: If documentation doesn't fit in the 5 allowed locations above, it should be:
1. Added to relevant PRP (technical/implementation details)
2. Added to README (user-facing guides)
3. **NOT** created as a new root-level file

**Enforcement**: PRs with new root-level .md files (except the 5 allowed) will be rejected.

## Code Review Process

### Before Submitting PR:
1. ✅ All tests pass (\`pytest tests/ -v\`)
2. ✅ Linting clean (\`ruff check .\`)
3. ✅ Formatting applied (\`ruff format .\`)
4. ✅ **CHANGELOG.md updated in [Unreleased] section**
5. ✅ **NO temporary .md files in root** (only allowed: README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, AGENTS, CLAUDE.md symlink)
6. ✅ PRP progress updated with checkboxes
7. ✅ Definition of Done (DOD) criteria met

### PR Description Must Include:
- **PRP Number**: e.g., "PRP-003"
- **Summary**: What was implemented
- **Changes Made**: Bullet list of changes
- **Definition of Done**: Copy DOD from PRP and check each item
- **CHANGELOG**: Reference to CHANGELOG.md update
- **Testing**: What tests were added/updated
- **Related PRs**: Link to PRs in other repos (e.g., GitOps, charts)
- **Next Steps**: What comes after this PR

### Code Review Checklist (Reviewer):
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] All DOD criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Code follows architecture patterns
- [ ] No linter/type errors
- [ ] PRP progress updated
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Related PRs linked in comments (if applicable)

### Deployment Flow:
1. **PR created** → CI runs tests, lint, format checks
2. **Code review** → Reviewer checks CHANGELOG, DOD, tests
3. **PR approved** → Merge to main
4. **Main merge** → Auto-deploy workflow runs:
   - Reads \`version.txt\`
   - Builds Docker image with version tags
   - Creates GitHub Release from CHANGELOG [Unreleased]
   - Pushes to GitHub Container Registry
   - Creates deployment record
5. **Version bump** → Manual update to \`version.txt\` for next release


11. **[PRP-011: Canary Deployment & Sister Bot Communication](PRPs/PRP-011.md)**
    - dcmaidbot-canary: happy little sister bot for testing
    - E2E production testing with cron automation
    - Status page with health checks
    - 5% canary release in Kubernetes
    - Inter-bot communication API for summary and tool sharing

## Infrastructure Workflow

When changes require infrastructure updates (Kubernetes, GitOps, etc.):

### Pattern:
1. **Main Repo** (dcmaidbot): Code & Docker images
2. **Infrastructure Repo** (uz0/core-charts): Helm charts & K8s manifests
3. **Link PRs**: Comment on main PR with infrastructure PR link

### Steps:
1. Implement feature in main repo
2. Create infrastructure changes in separate PR to uz0/core-charts
3. Comment on main PR with link to infrastructure PR
4. Both PRs reviewed and merged together
5. Auto-deployment via ArgoCD

### Example:
- **PR #3** (dcmaidbot): Infrastructure cleanup
- **PR #15** (core-charts): Add dcmaidbot Helm charts
- Comment on PR #3: "Related infrastructure PR: uz0/core-charts#15"

This ensures infrastructure changes are tracked and deployed together with code changes.

## Infrastructure Workflow

When changes require infrastructure updates (Kubernetes, GitOps, Helm charts):

### Pattern:
1. **Main Repo** (dcmaidbot): Code & Docker images
2. **Infrastructure Repo** (uz0/core-charts): Helm charts & K8s manifests
3. **Link PRs**: Comment on main PR with infrastructure PR link

### Steps:
1. Implement feature in main repo (dcmaidbot)
2. Create infrastructure changes in separate PR to uz0/core-charts
3. **Comment on main PR** with link to infrastructure PR
4. Both PRs reviewed and merged together
5. Auto-deployment via ArgoCD watches core-charts

### Example:
- **PR #3** (dcmaidbot): Infrastructure cleanup + Docker
- **PR #15** (core-charts): Add dcmaidbot Helm charts
- **Link**: Comment on PR #3: "🚀 GitOps PR: uz0/core-charts#15"

### Why This Matters:
- Keeps code and infrastructure in sync
- Reviewers see full picture
- Prevents orphaned infrastructure
- Enables proper GitOps workflow
- ArgoCD auto-deploys after merge

This pattern applies to all infrastructure PRPs (001, 011, etc.).
