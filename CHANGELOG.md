    - "Show me all my lessons"
    - "Edit lesson #3 to say..."
    - "Delete lesson #5"
  - **Security**: Non-admins get natural deflections, no access denied errors
    - Bot doesn't reveal that lesson features exist
    - Maintains kawaii personality even when denying access

### Fixed
- **Hotfix: /nudge LLM mode parameter bug** 🐛
  - Fixed incorrect `use_tools` parameter → `tools` in `NudgeService.send_via_llm()`
  - LLM mode now works correctly with personalized messaging
  - Direct mode was unaffected (working since v0.3.0)

### Changed
- **PRP-014 v0.2.0: Direct Telegram Messaging via /nudge** 🔄
  - **BREAKING**: Removed external endpoint forwarding (dcmaid.theedgestory.org/nudge)
  - `/nudge` now sends messages DIRECTLY via Telegram Bot API
  - Two messaging modes:
    - **direct**: Send markdown-formatted message as-is
    - **llm**: Process message through dcmaidbot LLM pipeline for personalized responses
  - New request schema: `{message, type, user_id?}` (simplified)
  - Removed superfluous fields: urgency, pr_url, prp_file, prp_section
  - Messages support full Markdown formatting
  - `user_id` optional - defaults to all ADMIN_IDS
  - Updated tests: 15 handler tests + 16 service tests
  - **Why**: Original architecture was incorrect - external endpoint didn't exist

### Added

- **Improved health endpoint** (`/health`)
  - Returns actual database connection status (ok/unavailable/error)
  - Returns actual Redis connection status (ok/unavailable/error)
  - Proper HTTP 503 response when database connection fails
  - Differentiate between not_configured and error states
- **Enhanced `/version` status page**
  - Database status shows "PostgreSQL connected" when healthy
  - Redis status shows proper connection state
  - Visual indicators (✅/⏳/❌) reflect real service status

### Changed
- `get_health_status()` is now async and performs actual health checks
- Health handler awaits `get_health_status()` for real-time status
- Database health considered critical (bot unhealthy if DB error)
- Redis health considered optional (bot healthy even if Redis unavailable)

### Fixed
- Health endpoint no longer shows "pending" for working PostgreSQL connection
- Proper error messages when database connection fails
- Status page now accurately reflects production service health
