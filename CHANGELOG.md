- **PRP-017: Role-Based Access Control & Admin Lesson Tools** üîê
  - Created `tools/lesson_tools.py` with 4 admin-only lesson management tools
    - `get_all_lessons` - List all lessons with IDs and content
    - `create_lesson` - Add new lesson through natural conversation
    - `edit_lesson` - Update existing lesson content
    - `delete_lesson` - Remove lesson (soft delete)
  - Created `services/auth_service.py` for centralized authentication
    - `is_admin(user_id)` - Check if user has admin permissions
    - `get_role(user_id)` - Get user role ("admin" or "user")
    - `filter_tools_by_role()` - Filter tools based on user permissions
    - `is_admin_only_tool()` - Check if tool requires admin access
  - Created `handlers/help.py` with role-aware /help command
    - Admins see full command list including lesson management
    - Non-admins see only public commands
    - Different tool descriptions based on role
  - Enhanced `tools/tool_executor.py` with role-based access control
    - Admin-only tools return vague deflection for non-admins
    - "I'm not sure what you mean by that! üòä" instead of permission errors
    - Prevents leaking information about admin-only features
  - Updated `handlers/waifu.py` and `handlers/call.py`
    - Filter tools by user role before passing to LLM
    - Admins get lesson tools, non-admins don't
    - Seamless integration with existing tool system
  - Comprehensive test suite (26 tests total):
    - 10 tests for AuthService (role checking, tool filtering)
    - 16 tests for lesson tools (tool definitions, RBAC, execution)
    - All tests passing with full coverage
  - **Feature**: Admins can now manage lessons conversationally
    - "Save this as a lesson: Always be enthusiastic!"
    - "Show me all my lessons"
    - "Edit lesson #3 to say..."
    - "Delete lesson #5"
  - **Security**: Non-admins get natural deflections, no access denied errors
    - Bot doesn't reveal that lesson features exist
    - Maintains kawaii personality even when denying access

### Fixed
- **Hotfix: /nudge LLM mode parameter bug** üêõ
  - Fixed incorrect `use_tools` parameter ‚Üí `tools` in `NudgeService.send_via_llm()`
  - LLM mode now works correctly with personalized messaging
  - Direct mode was unaffected (working since v0.3.0)

### Changed
- **PRP-014 v0.2.0: Direct Telegram Messaging via /nudge** üîÑ
  - **BREAKING**: Removed external endpoint forwarding (dcmaid.theedgestory.org/nudge)
  - `/nudge` now sends messages DIRECTLY via Telegram Bot API
  - Two messaging modes:
    - **direct**: Send markdown-formatted message as-is
    - **llm**: Process message through dcmaidbot LLM pipeline for personalized responses
  - New request schema: `{message, type, user_id?}` (simplified)
  - Removed superfluous fields: urgency, pr_url, prp_file, prp_section
  - Messages support full Markdown formatting
  - `user_id` optional - defaults to all ADMIN_IDS
  - Updated tests: 15 handler tests + 16 service tests
  - **Why**: Original architecture was incorrect - external endpoint didn't exist

### Added
- **PRP-005 Phase 2: Agentic Tools Integration** ü§ñüéä
  - Bot is now FULLY AGENTIC - can autonomously use tools!
  - `tools/memory_tools.py`: Memory management tools (create_memory, search_memories, get_memory)
  - `tools/web_search_tools.py`: Web search tool using DuckDuckGo (no API key needed)
  - `tools/tool_executor.py`: Tool execution engine with automatic VAD + Zettelkasten extraction
  - Bot autonomously creates memories when users share important information
  - Bot searches memories to recall past conversations
  - Bot searches web for current information
  - `services/llm_service.py`: Tool support with OpenAI function calling
  - `handlers/waifu.py` and `handlers/call.py`: Process tool calls from LLM
  - `tests/e2e/test_agentic_tools_with_judge.py`: Comprehensive E2E test with batch LLM judge
  - Automatic importance scoring, VAD emotion extraction, Zettelkasten attributes on memory creation
- **PRP-005 Phase 1: Memory and Message History in Bot Responses** üéâ
  - Integrated MemoryService into handlers/waifu.py - bot now fetches relevant memories
  - Integrated MessageService for message history tracking (last 20 messages)
  - Bot stores all incoming/outgoing messages to database for context
  - LLM prompts now include memories and conversation history
  - /call endpoint updated to use full context (memories + history + lessons)
  - Bot responses now contextually aware of past conversations and stored facts
- **/call endpoint - Direct bot logic testing** üÜï **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**
  - POST /call endpoint for testing bot logic without Telegram
  - Same authentication as /nudge (NUDGE_SECRET)
  - Accepts user_id + command or message
  - Returns bot's response directly (no Telegram involved)
  - Perfect for CI/CD automation
  - tests/e2e_call_endpoint.py: Automated E2E tests via /call
  - handlers/call.py: Bot logic abstracted from Telegram
  - **Why**: Telegram bots can't message users who haven't initiated chat
  - **Solution**: Bypass Telegram entirely, test bot logic directly
- **E2E Production Validation System**
  - tests/e2e_production.py: Infrastructure and health testing
  - tests/e2e_user_stories.py: **Real user story and feature testing**
  - **tests/e2e_with_userbot.py: Automated bot-to-bot testing using Pyrogram** üÜï
    - Uses Pyrogram (MTProto) to act as a real Telegram user
    - Sends messages to bot and verifies responses
    - Solves "chat not found" error in automated tests
    - Supports session persistence (tests/userbot.session)
    - Requires Telegram API credentials (api_id, api_hash)
  - Tests ALL bot commands: /start, /help, /status, /joke, /love, /view_lessons
  - Tests LLM integration: waifu personality, streaming responses, joke generation
  - Tests memory system: PostgreSQL database, Redis caching
  - Tests /nudge endpoint for agent communication
  - GitHub Actions workflow for automated E2E testing after each deployment
  - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
  - 11 user story tests covering all implemented PRPs
  - **tests/README.md: Comprehensive E2E testing documentation**
- **/api/version endpoint** - Lightweight JSON API for landing page
  - Returns version, commit, uptime, service statuses
  - Used by landing page for dynamic version display
  - Replaces HTML scraping from old /version endpoint
- **Test Bot Configuration (@dcnotabot)**
  - Dedicated test bot for E2E testing
  - Stored in Kubernetes secret: dcmaidbot-test-secrets
  - GitHub Actions secrets: BOT_TOKEN, TEST_ADMIN_ID, NUDGE_SECRET
  - Local .env file for development testing
  - Automated /call endpoint E2E tests in GitHub Actions workflow

### Changed
- **Removed /version endpoint** - version info now only on landing page (/)
- Landing page now fetches live data from /api/version JSON endpoint
- Hero version badge shows "Loading..." until API response arrives
- Health endpoint remains at /health for Kubernetes probes

### Removed
- /version HTML endpoint (replaced by /api/version JSON API)
