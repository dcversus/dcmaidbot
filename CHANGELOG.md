## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- **Real-time database health checks** in StatusService
  - `get_database_status()` now actually tests PostgreSQL connection with `SELECT 1`
  - `get_redis_status()` now tests Redis connection with `ping()`
  - Database engine passed to StatusService initialization
  - Async health check implementation
- **Improved health endpoint** (`/health`)
  - Returns actual database connection status (ok/unavailable/error)
  - Returns actual Redis connection status (ok/unavailable/error)
  - Proper HTTP 503 response when database connection fails
  - Differentiate between not_configured and error states
- **Enhanced `/version` status page**
  - Database status shows "PostgreSQL connected" when healthy
  - Redis status shows proper connection state
  - Visual indicators (‚úÖ/‚è≥/‚ùå) reflect real service status

### Changed
- `get_health_status()` is now async and performs actual health checks
- Health handler awaits `get_health_status()` for real-time status
- Database health considered critical (bot unhealthy if DB error)
- Redis health considered optional (bot healthy even if Redis unavailable)

### Fixed
- Health endpoint no longer shows "pending" for working PostgreSQL connection
- Proper error messages when database connection fails
- Status page now accurately reflects production service health
