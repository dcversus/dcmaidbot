# Phase 2 Implementation Status

**Phase**: Intelligence Features
**PRPs**: 6-7 (Joke Learning + RAG System)
**Current Status**: Not Started (0%)

## Prerequisites Check:

### Dependencies from Phase 1:
- [ ] PRP-003: PostgreSQL (needed for joke storage & RAG)
- [ ] PRP-004: Memories (needed for learning patterns)
- [ ] OpenAI API key configured

**Status**: ⚠️ Phase 1 must complete first

## PRP-006: Joking System with Learning

### Status: 0% Complete

**What it does:**
- Detects opportunities to make jokes
- Generates jokes in any language
- Learns from reactions (likes)
- Avoids jokes with no likes
- Creates more jokes similar to liked ones

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Bot deployed (PRP-001)
- ⏳ PostgreSQL (PRP-003) - stores jokes & reactions
- ⏳ OpenAI API - generates jokes
- ⏳ Telegram reactions - tracks likes

**Work Required:**
- models/joke.py (Joke model)
- services/joke_service.py (generation & learning)
- Reaction tracking system
- LLM integration for joke generation
- Learning algorithm (pattern matching)
- Unit tests + E2E test

**Estimate**: 3-4 days

---

## PRP-007: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

### Status: 0% Complete

**What it does:**
- Vector embeddings for all messages
- Semantic search across chat history
- Context-aware responses
- Remembers past conversations
- Smart joke context retrieval

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Bot deployed (PRP-001)
- ⏳ PostgreSQL (PRP-003) - stores messages
- ⏳ pgvector extension - vector similarity search
- ⏳ OpenAI embeddings API
- ⏳ Message history (PRP-003)

**Work Required:**
- Install pgvector extension
- services/rag_service.py (embeddings & search)
- Vector column in Message model
- Embedding generation for messages
- Semantic search implementation
- Integration with responses & jokes
- Unit tests + E2E test

**Estimate**: 4-5 days

## Phase 2 Readiness Assessment:

### ❌ Cannot Start Yet Because:
1. **No PostgreSQL** (PRP-003 not done)
   - Can't store jokes
   - Can't store message embeddings
   - Can't track reactions

2. **No OpenAI API key configured**
   - Can't generate jokes
   - Can't create embeddings

3. **No message history** (PRP-003)
   - No data for RAG
   - No context to learn from

### ✅ When Ready to Start:

**Prerequisites needed:**
1. PRP-003 complete (PostgreSQL + models)
2. OpenAI API key in secrets
3. pgvector extension installed
4. Message storage working

**Then Phase 2 can begin!**

---

## Recommended Approach:

### Focus Order:
1. **Complete Phase 1 first** (PRPs 2-4)
   - Webhook mode
   - PostgreSQL
   - Memories

2. **Then Phase 2** (PRPs 6-7)
   - Jokes (needs DB + API)
   - RAG (needs DB + pgvector)

### Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Phase 1 completion
- **Week 2**: Phase 2 implementation
- **Week 3**: Phase 2 polish + testing

## Phase 2 Value Proposition:

**PRP-006 (Jokes):**
- 🎭 Makes conversations fun
- 📊 Learns from feedback
- 🌍 Works in any language
- 💡 Gets better over time

**PRP-007 (RAG):**
- 🧠 Remembers everything
- 💭 Context-aware responses
- 🔍 Finds relevant past conversations
- ✨ Truly intelligent bot

**Together:** A kawai bot that's funny AND smart! 💕

---

**Current Focus**: Complete Phase 1 (PRPs 2-4) first
**Phase 2 Start**: After PostgreSQL & memories working

Nya~ Phase 2 will make me SO much smarter! 🎀
