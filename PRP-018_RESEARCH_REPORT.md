# PRP-018 Research Report: Multi-Platform Messenger Abstraction Layer

**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Research Specialist**: Claude Code Agent
**Scope**: Deep analysis of Telegram and Discord features for unified abstraction layer design

## Executive Summary

This research provides a comprehensive analysis of Telegram and Discord messenger platform capabilities, with the goal of designing a robust abstraction layer that will enable dcmaidbot to operate seamlessly across both platforms. The analysis reveals significant opportunities for feature unification while identifying key platform-specific differences that must be accommodated.

**Key Finding**: Both platforms offer rich interactive capabilities that align well with dcmaidbot's requirements for character interaction, rich content delivery, and user engagement. The abstraction layer is technically feasible and will provide significant value.

## 1. Current System Analysis

### 1.1 Existing Telegram Implementation

The current `/Users/dcversus/Documents/GitHub/dcmaidbot/services/messenger_service.py` provides a solid foundation for platform abstraction:

**Strengths:**
- Clean abstract base class `MessengerService` with well-defined interface
- Comprehensive `RichContent` dataclass supporting multiple message types
- `TelegramService` implementation with extensive markdown parsing
- Button handling system with inline and reply keyboard support
- Media handling for photos, videos, documents, and audio
- Proper error handling and response standardization

**Message Types Supported:**
- TEXT, MARKDOWN, PHOTO, VIDEO, DOCUMENT, LOCATION, CONTACT, POLL, VENUE, AUDIO, VOICE, VIDEO_NOTE, STICKER

**Current Limitations:**
- Telegram-specific parsing methods (HTML conversion)
- Platform-dependent button chunking logic
- Hard-coded Telegram API calls in implementation
- Limited to 3 buttons per row (Telegram constraint)

### 1.2 Architecture Foundation

The existing architecture follows the Factory pattern with:
- `MessengerFactory` for service creation
- Singleton pattern for service access
- Clean separation between interface and implementation
- Extensible design for new platforms

        """Convert unified interactions to platform-specific format."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def handle_platform_specific_features(self, content: UnifiedRichContent) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Handle features unique to this platform."""
        pass
```

## 5. Discord Service Implementation Design

### 5.1 DiscordService Class Structure
