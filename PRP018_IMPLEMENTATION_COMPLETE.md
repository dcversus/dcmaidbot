  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "unique_event_123",
    "user_id": 12345,
    "event_type": "button_click",
    "button_text": "Start Game",
    "data": {"screen": "main_menu"}
  }'
```

### LLM Tool Usage

### RPG Game Master
```python
# Create game session
result = await game_master_action(
    action="create_session",
    game_data={
        "name": "Dragon Adventure",
        "difficulty_level": "normal",
        "max_players": 4
    }
)

# Join game
result = await game_master_action(
    action="join_session",
    session_id="rpg_xxxxx",
    user_id=12345,
    game_data={"character_name": "Hero", "character_class": "warrior"}
)

# Process action
result = await game_master_action(
    action="process_action",
    session_id="rpg_xxxxx",
    user_id=12345,
    game_data={"action": "move", "destination": "tavern"}
)
```
