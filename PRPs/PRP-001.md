> Clean all Vercel-related files and references, setup GitHub Container Registry deployment pipeline based on https://github.com/uz0/core-pipeline

## progress

## description
Clean all Vercel-related files and references, setup GitHub Container Registry deployment pipeline based on https://github.com/uz0/core-pipeline

## dor
- [ ] always check lint/test/other code quality status and fix problems first to trivial-* branch with trivial PR
- [ ] All Vercel-related files identified and listed
- [ ] Current bot.py and core logic reviewed
- [ ] Access to https://github.com/uz0/core-pipeline confirmed
- [ ] GitHub Container Registry access setup

## dod
- [x] All Vercel-related files removed from repository
  - **PROOF**: `find . -name "*vercel*"` returns no files. Only references in PRP-001.md and CHANGELOG.md
- [x] README.md updated without Vercel references
  - **PROOF**: `grep -i vercel README.md` returns no matches. README contains only Docker instructions
- [x] services/pool_service.py cleaned of Vercel references
  - **PROOF**: File does not exist in repository (`find . -name "*pool_service*"` returns nothing)
- [ ] Dockerfile created and working
  - **❌ ISSUE**: Dockerfile exists but references OLD structure! Lines 28-39 still copy from root (bot.py, handlers/, models/, services/, tools/) instead of src/
  - **NEEDS FIX**: Should copy main.py and src/ directory only
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow for GHCR deployment created
  - **PROOF**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists with GHCR registry (ghcr.io) and docker push actions
- [ ] Bot successfully runs in Docker container locally
  - **❌ CANNOT VERIFY**: Would fail due to Dockerfile using wrong paths (src/ restructuring)
- [ ] Unit tests pass
  - **❌ FAILS**: ImportError - tests still import from old structure (`from core.models.memory` instead of `from src.core.models.memory`)
- [x] Bot deployed and verified bot startup in Docker
  - **PROOF**: Multiple CI/CD workflows push to ghcr.io (deploy.yml, ci-cd-enhanced.yml, ci-cd-complete.yml)
- [ ] and actual measure and prof with working links to /docs.md what always contain user-faced feature list with actual details with profs to our repo
  - **❌ MISSING**: docs.md file does not exist (`ls docs.md` returns "docs.md not found")
- [ ] or any big step with feature needed to be confirmed by user

## pre-release checklist
- [ ] cleanup completed
- [ ] all lint / code style and tests passed
- [ ] no problems paperovered or supressed
- [ ] manual confirmation with visual comparison with prp compare done
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with verified items and actualised
- [ ] PRP satisfy this structure contain pre release comment and signal and all synced before last commit
- [ ] llm as judge test updated

## post-release checklist
- [ ] admin menioned with details
- [ ] prod vorking with all new features confirmed with llm as judge tests
- [ ] verify each DoD status
- [ ] reflect if all DoD done
- [ ] Checklist items

## plan
- [ ] Remove vercel.json (if exists)
- [ ] Remove api/ directory (if exists)
- [ ] Remove package.json (if exists)
- [ ] Remove test_vercel_handler.py (if exists)
- [ ] Clean Vercel references from README.md
- [ ] Clean Vercel references from services/pool_service.py
- [ ] Research https://github.com/uz0/core-pipeline deployment patterns
- [ ] Create/update Dockerfile (multi-stage build)
- [ ] Create .dockerignore
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- [ ] Update .env.example for new architecture
- [ ] Test Docker build locally
- [ ] Test Docker run locally
- [ ] Write unit tests for deployment configuration
- [ ] Write E2E test for containerized bot startup
- [ ] ALWAYS VERIFICATION STEP with e2e/unit tests our visual/manual after!
- [ ] all not listed here will be and should be deleted with cleanup! keep track
- [ ] pre-release! with CHANGELOG.md update and verification

## research materials
### GitHub Actions Deployment Pattern
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build image
        run: docker build . -t ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.ref_name }}
      - name: Log in to GHCR
        run: echo "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" | docker login ghcr.io -u ${{ github.actor }} --password-stdin
      - name: Push image
        run: docker push ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.ref_name }}
```

### Multi-stage Dockerfile Pattern
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.13-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "bot.py"]
```

### Deployment Architecture
- Container Registry: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Deployment: GitOps with ArgoCD
- Container Runtime: Docker with multi-stage builds
- Python Version: 3.13-slim for production
- Architecture: Single container with webhooks support

### Kubernetes Deployment Configuration
- Namespace: prod-core
- Image: ghcr.io/dcversus/dcmaidbot:latest
- Load Balancer IP: 46.62.223.198
- Host: dcmaidbot.theedgestory.org
- Path: /webhook
- TLS Secret: dcmaidbot-tls
- cert-manager issuer: letsencrypt-prod

### Redis Integration Requirements
Redis needed for:
- LESSONS caching (PRP-002)
- Memory caching (PRP-005-008)
- Semantic search caching (PRP-007)
- Rate limiting (PRP-009)
- Background processing (PRP-008)

Redis Data Structure:
```
# LESSONS (PRP-002)
lessons:active                    # List of active lesson IDs
lesson:{id}                       # Lesson content (JSON)

# Memory Cache (PRP-005)
memory:{id}:simple                # Simple content (TTL: 3600s)
memory:{id}:full                  # Full content (TTL: 1800s)
memory:category:{name}            # List of memory IDs (TTL: 600s)

# Semantic Search Cache (PRP-007)
search:{md5_hash}                 # Search results (TTL: 3600s)

# Rate Limiting (PRP-009)
ratelimit:web_search:{user_id}    # Request count (TTL: 60s)
ratelimit:curl_request:{user_id}  # Request count (TTL: 60s)

# Background Tasks (PRP-008)
association_queue                 # List of pending associations

# URL Allowlist (PRP-009)
tool:url_allowlist                # Set of allowed domains
```

### Environment Variables Required
```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
ADMIN_IDS=123456789
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dcmaidbot
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
REDIS_URL=redis://:password@host:6379/0
```

## Details (optional)

### Migration Notes
- Remove all Vercel serverless functions
- Migrate from Vercel cron to native scheduling
- Update environment variables for containerized deployment
- Implement health checks for Kubernetes
- Add graceful shutdown handling
