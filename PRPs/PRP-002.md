### 2025-10-27 - Audit Results
**Status**: üü° PARTIAL (40% complete)

**Gaps Found**: 7 major gaps

2. ‚ùå Non-admin ignore logic missing (security issue!)
3. üü° Waifu personality incomplete (basic responses only)
4. üü° Kawai expressions inconsistent
5. ‚ùå Bilingual responses not implemented
6. ‚ùå Unit tests for admin detection missing
7. ‚ùå Unit tests for protector mode missing
8. ‚ùå E2E test for waifu interaction missing

**Critical Issues**:
- **Security**: Bot responds to ALL users (should ignore 99%)
- **Core Feature Missing**: Protector mode not implemented
- **Test Coverage**: 0% for PRP-002 features

**Recommended Action**:
Create PRP-002.1 to complete missing features before moving to PRP-004
