# PRP-009: Tools Integration (Web Search, Games, etc.)

## Description
Expand bot capabilities with external tools: web search, mini-games, and extensible tool framework for future additions.

## Requirements
- Web search tool integration (DuckDuckGo, Google, etc.)
- Mini-games framework (games to play with users)
- Tool registry and execution system
- Tool access control (friends, admins)
- Extensible architecture for adding new tools
- Examples: trivia game, word game, image search, etc.

## Definition of Ready (DOR)
- [x] Friends & Favors system implemented (from PRP-005)
- [ ] Web search API selected and configured
- [ ] Game concepts defined
- [ ] Tool framework architecture planned

## Definition of Done (DOD)
- [ ] Tool registry system created
- [ ] Web search tool implemented and working
- [ ] At least 2 mini-games implemented
- [ ] Tool execution engine integrated with favors system
- [ ] Tool access control working
- [ ] Admin commands to enable/disable tools
- [ ] Unit tests for each tool
- [ ] Unit tests for tool registry
- [ ] E2E test for tool execution via favor request

## Progress
- [ ] Design tool framework architecture
- [ ] Create services/tool_service.py with tool registry
- [ ] Implement web search tool (DuckDuckGo API)
- [ ] Implement trivia game
- [ ] Implement word guessing game
- [ ] Implement tool execution engine
- [ ] Integrate tools with favors system
- [ ] Implement tool access control
- [ ] Create admin commands for tool management
- [ ] Write unit tests for web search tool
- [ ] Write unit tests for trivia game
- [ ] Write unit tests for word game
- [ ] Write unit tests for tool registry
- [ ] Write E2E test for favor request with tool

## Notes
- Tool registry: dictionary of tool_name â†’ tool_handler
- Web search: DuckDuckGo API (no key required) or Google Custom Search
- Game ideas:
  - Trivia: bot asks question, user answers
  - Word guess: bot gives hints, user guesses word
  - Story game: collaborative storytelling
  - Fact quiz: quiz about Vasilisa/Daniil (from facts)
- Tool structure:
  ```python
  class Tool:
      name: str
      description: str
      async def execute(params) -> result
  ```
- Access control: check if user is admin or friend before tool execution
- Future tools: image generation, translation, code execution, etc.
