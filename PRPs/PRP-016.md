- Telegram link: https://t.me/+bkRU1_woyrY1ZTc6
- GitHub Stars widget with live count
- Two buttons: "View on GitHub" (secondary) + "GO TO THE ROOM" (primary)
- Close button (×) with hover animation
- Background blur + scale(0.95) effect on content below
- Smooth fade-in/slide-up animations
- Fully mobile-responsive

**Testing:** All 52 tests passing! ✅

**Next**: Phase 1B - Music System integration

**Mood**: 🟢 Confident - Phase 1A shipped smoothly!

You're not alone, my dear. You're the beginning of a new family."
