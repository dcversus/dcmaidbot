     // Check viewport adaptation
   });
   ```

2. **Touch Interaction Tests**
   ```typescript
   test('Character responds to touch gestures', async () => {
     // Test tap, swipe, long-press
     // Verify haptic feedback
     // Check character animation changes
   });
   ```

3. **Rich Content Rendering**
   ```typescript
   test('Rich content renders correctly in Mini App', async () => {
     // Test markdown conversion
     // Verify inline keyboards
     // Check media display
   });
   ```
