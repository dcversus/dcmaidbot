### 🔧 Technical Architecture Details

**Service Layer Architecture:**
```python
# Discord Service Hierarchy
DiscordService (extends MessengerService)
├── DiscordBot (discord.py integration)
├── ContentConverter (cross-platform conversion)
├── ComponentMapper (interaction mapping)
├── CommandRouter (slash command handling)
└── UserManager (cross-platform user management)
```

**Integration Points:**
- **MessengerService Interface**: Unified messaging abstraction
- **MemoryService**: Cross-platform memory storage
- **CharacterService**: Consistent personality across platforms
- **AnalyticsService**: User interaction tracking
- **NudgeService**: Cross-platform notifications

**Configuration Management:**
```python
# Environment Variables
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id (optional)
DISCORD_ADMIN_IDS=comma_separated_admin_ids
DISCORD_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DISCORD_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH=2000
DISCORD_EMBED_COLOR=0x3498db
```

### Integration with Existing System

1. **Messenger Service Extension**
   ```python
   class MessengerFactory:
       @staticmethod
       def create_messenger(platform: str = "telegram") -> MessengerService:
           if platform.lower() == "telegram":
               return TelegramService()
           elif platform.lower() == "discord":
               return DiscordService()
           else:
               raise ValueError(f"Unsupported platform: {platform}")
   ```

2. **Multi-Platform Configuration**
   ```python
   # config/platforms.py
   PLATFORM_CONFIGS = {
       "telegram": {
           "bot_token": os.getenv("TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"),
           "enabled": True
       },
       "discord": {
           "bot_token": os.getenv("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"),
           "enabled": True,
           "guild_id": os.getenv("DISCORD_GUILD_ID")  # Optional
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Unified User Management**
   ```python
   class UnifiedUser:
       """User representation across platforms."""
       platform_user_id: str
       platform: str
       display_name: str
       preferences: Dict[str, Any]

       def get_canonical_id(self) -> str:
           """Get platform-independent user ID."""
           return f"{self.platform}:{self.platform_user_id}"
   ```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **Discord Service Tests**
   ```python
   async def test_discord_service_initialization():
       service = DiscordService(token="test_token")
       assert service.platform_name == "Discord"
       assert service.client is not None

   async def test_content_conversion():
       content = RichContent(
           content="Test message",
           message_type=MessageType.TEXT
       )
       discord_content = await service.convert_to_discord_format(content)
       assert discord_content is not None
   ```

2. **Command Registration Tests**
   ```python
   async def test_slash_command_registration():
       bot = DiscordBot()
       await bot.register_discord_commands()
       # Verify commands are registered
   ```

### Integration Tests

1. **Cross-Platform Tests**
   ```python
   async def test_cross_platform_message():
       # Send same content via Telegram and Discord
       # Verify consistent behavior
   ```

2. **Content Conversion Tests**
   ```python
   async def test_rich_content_conversion():
       # Test conversion of all content types
       # Verify Discord-specific formatting
   ```

### E2E Tests

1. **Full Discord Interaction Flow**
   ```python
   async def test_discord_user_journey():
       # User joins Discord server
       # User uses slash commands
       # User interacts with components
       # Verify character consistency
   ```
