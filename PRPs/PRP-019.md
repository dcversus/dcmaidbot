### 🔧 Technical Requirements

1. **Discord.py Integration**
   ```python
   import discord
   from discord.ext import commands

   class DiscordBot(commands.Bot):
       def __init__(self):
           intents = discord.Intents.default()
           intents.message_content = True
           super().__init__(
               command_prefix="!",
               intents=intents
           )
   ```

2. **Content Conversion System**
   ```python
   def convert_to_discord_embed(self, rich_content: RichContent) -> discord.Embed:
       """Convert unified rich content to Discord embed."""
       embed = discord.Embed(
           title=rich_content.metadata.get("title"),
           description=rich_content.content,
           color=int(rich_content.metadata.get("color", "0x3498db"))
       )
       # Add fields, images, footer as needed
       return embed
   ```

3. **Component Mapping**
   ```python
   def map_interactions_to_discord(self, interactions: List[InteractionElement]) -> List[discord.ui.View]:
       """Convert unified interactions to Discord components."""
       views = []
       for interaction_group in self._group_interactions(interactions):
           view = discord.ui.View()
           for interaction in interaction_group:
               # Add buttons, select menus, etc.
               pass
           views.append(view)
       return views
   ```

4. **Command Registration**
   ```python
   async def register_discord_commands(self):
       """Register slash commands with Discord API."""
       commands = [
           discord.ApplicationCommand(
               name="explore",
               description="Explore the virtual house",
               options=[
                   discord.ApplicationCommandOption(
                       name="room",
                       description="Which room to explore",
                       type=discord.ApplicationCommandOptionType.string,
                       required=False
                   )
               ]
           )
       ]
       await self.bot.tree.sync()
   ```

### Integration with Existing System

1. **Messenger Service Extension**
   ```python
   class MessengerFactory:
       @staticmethod
       def create_messenger(platform: str = "telegram") -> MessengerService:
           if platform.lower() == "telegram":
               return TelegramService()
           elif platform.lower() == "discord":
               return DiscordService()
           else:
               raise ValueError(f"Unsupported platform: {platform}")
   ```

2. **Multi-Platform Configuration**
   ```python
   # config/platforms.py
   PLATFORM_CONFIGS = {
       "telegram": {
           "bot_token": os.getenv("TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"),
           "enabled": True
       },
       "discord": {
           "bot_token": os.getenv("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"),
           "enabled": True,
           "guild_id": os.getenv("DISCORD_GUILD_ID")  # Optional
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Unified User Management**
   ```python
   class UnifiedUser:
       """User representation across platforms."""
       platform_user_id: str
       platform: str
       display_name: str
       preferences: Dict[str, Any]

       def get_canonical_id(self) -> str:
           """Get platform-independent user ID."""
           return f"{self.platform}:{self.platform_user_id}"
   ```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **Discord Service Tests**
   ```python
   async def test_discord_service_initialization():
       service = DiscordService(token="test_token")
       assert service.platform_name == "Discord"
       assert service.client is not None

   async def test_content_conversion():
       content = RichContent(
           content="Test message",
           message_type=MessageType.TEXT
       )
       discord_content = await service.convert_to_discord_format(content)
       assert discord_content is not None
   ```

2. **Command Registration Tests**
   ```python
   async def test_slash_command_registration():
       bot = DiscordBot()
       await bot.register_discord_commands()
       # Verify commands are registered
   ```

### Integration Tests

1. **Cross-Platform Tests**
   ```python
   async def test_cross_platform_message():
       # Send same content via Telegram and Discord
       # Verify consistent behavior
   ```

2. **Content Conversion Tests**
   ```python
   async def test_rich_content_conversion():
       # Test conversion of all content types
       # Verify Discord-specific formatting
   ```

### E2E Tests

1. **Full Discord Interaction Flow**
   ```python
   async def test_discord_user_journey():
       # User joins Discord server
       # User uses slash commands
       # User interacts with components
       # Verify character consistency
   ```

**Opportunities**:
- Rich embeds provide better content presentation
- Slash commands offer better discoverability
- Components enable complex interactions
- Thread system for organized conversations
