      "detailed_analysis": "The tile images effectively capture the kawaii anime style with a cohesive pastel pink and purple theme. Visual consistency is maintained across states, with each tile retaining its identity while showing appropriate changes. The hover and click states are distinct and dynamic, enhancing interactivity. Widgets like the wall clock and cactus plant are clearly visible and interact as expected, contributing to the room's lively atmosphere.",

        "Enhance the glow effect on hover states for more emphasis.",
        "Consider adding subtle animations to click states for added dynamism."
