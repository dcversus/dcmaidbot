"""Comprehensive E2E tests for agentic tools with LLM-as-judge validation.

This test suite validates that the bot can autonomously use tools:
- create_memory: Bot creates memories when user shares important info
- search_memories: Bot searches memories to recall information
- web_search: Bot searches web for current information

All tests use REAL LLM calls and LLM-as-judge for validation.
