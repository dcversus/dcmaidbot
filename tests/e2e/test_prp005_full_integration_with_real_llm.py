"""E2E tests for ALL PRP-005 features with REAL LLM integration.

These tests verify that PRP-005 advanced memory features work end-to-end:
1. Bot creates enhanced links with REAL LLM strength calculation
2. Bot versions memories when information changes
3. Bot compacts memories approaching 4000 tokens with REAL LLM
4. Bot extracts VAD emotions with REAL LLM
5. Bot generates Zettelkasten attributes with REAL LLM

ALL tests use REAL OpenAI API calls (not mocked) and LLM-as-judge validation.

Run with: pytest tests/e2e/test_prp005_full_integration_with_real_llm.py -v -s -m integration
