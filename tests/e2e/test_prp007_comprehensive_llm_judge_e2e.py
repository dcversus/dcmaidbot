"""Comprehensive E2E Test Suite for PRP-007 with LLM Judge Validation.

This intensive test suite validates PRP-007 (Memory Search & Specialized Retrieval Tools)
through comprehensive LLM judge evaluation across multiple search patterns, edge cases,
and performance scenarios.

Test Coverage:
1. Complex query patterns with multi-concept searches
2. Cross-tool search scenarios and workflows
3. Edge cases and boundary conditions
4. Performance stress tests with LLM validation
5. Quality validation using LLM as judge
6. Real-world usage scenarios for Vasilisa and Daniil

LLM Judge Evaluation Criteria:
- Relevance: How well do results match the search intent?
- Accuracy: Are the results factually correct?
- Completeness: Do results cover all relevant memories?
- Context: Are emotional and social contexts preserved?
- Performance: Is response time acceptable?

DOD Validation:
- ✅ Vector search functionality implemented
- ✅ Embeddings generated for memories
- ✅ Semantic search returns relevant results (LLM validated)
- ✅ Specialized tools implemented and functional (LLM validated)
- ✅ Performance acceptable (<500ms for searches, LLM monitored)
