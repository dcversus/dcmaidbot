"""Intensive E2E Validation for PRP-007 with Focused Testing.

This test suite provides intensive validation of PRP-007 (Memory Search & Specialized Retrieval Tools)
with realistic performance expectations and focused LLM judge validation.

Key Features:
1. Complex search patterns with multi-concept queries
2. Cross-tool workflow testing
3. Edge cases and boundary conditions
4. Performance stress testing
5. Strategic LLM judge validation (not every call)
6. Real-world usage scenarios for Vasilisa and Daniil

Performance Expectations:
- Core tool operations: <500ms (no LLM calls)
- LLM judge evaluations: <10s (when used)
- Comprehensive workflows: <15s total
