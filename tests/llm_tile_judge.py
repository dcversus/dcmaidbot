LLM Tile Judge System
====================

Uses LLM to analyze tile generation failures and provide detailed feedback:
- Analyzes failed E2E tests with visual context
- Provides detailed analysis of tile quality issues
- Writes findings to related PRP files
- Offers recommendations for improvement

JUDGE CRITERIA:
1. Visual Consistency: Do tiles maintain visual identity across states?
2. State Transitions: Are hover/click states appropriately different?
3. Widget Visibility: Are interactive elements properly visible?
4. Overall Quality: Does the tile meet kawaii anime style expectations?

You are an expert judge for anime-style tile generation quality. Please analyze the provided tile images and test results.

CONTEXT:
- Location: {tile_info.get("name", "Unknown")}
- Description: {tile_info.get("description", "No description")}
- Style: kawaii anime, peaceful atmosphere, pastel colors

TILE STATES TO ANALYZE:
- Idle: Normal peaceful state
- Hover: Interactive highlight state (should have soft glow/aura)
- Click: Active interaction state (should be more dynamic/magical)

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Visual Consistency (25%): Do tiles maintain visual identity across states while showing appropriate changes?
2. State Transitions (25%): Are hover/click states appropriately different from idle?
3. Widget Visibility (25%): Are interactive elements (clock, book, poster, etc.) properly visible and clear?
4. Style Compliance (25%): Does the tile meet kawaii anime style expectations?

TEST RESULTS:
{json.dumps(test_results, indent=2)}

Please provide:
1. Overall quality score (0-100)
2. Individual scores for each criterion
3. Detailed analysis of what works and what doesn't
4. Specific recommendations for improvement
5. Pass/Fail determination (minimum 70% overall score to pass)
